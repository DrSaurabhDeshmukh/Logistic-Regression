# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. 
In a classification problem, the target variable (or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features (or inputs), X. 
Contrary to popular belief, logistic regression IS a regression model.

What is binary logistic regression with example?
Binary logistic regression is the statistical technique used to predict the relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and the independent variable (X), where the dependent variable is binary in nature. For example, the output can be Success/Failure, 0/1 , True/False, or Yes/No.
